# League of Legends Randomzier
Python script that randomizes champions, lanes and items from Riot's DataDragon dataset.

Through the user's input, the script randomly picks a champion, a lane and a build (containing one Mythic item, four Legendaries and one pair of boots).
The champion and items name will be translated to the the user's input region.
